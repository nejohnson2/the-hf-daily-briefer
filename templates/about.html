<h1>About</h1>
<p>
    This site automatically generates a daily report about a trending model or
    dataset from <a href="https://huggingface.co">HuggingFace</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Every day, a scheduled job picks a random trending item, sends its metadata
    to an LLM, and generates a grounded summary with 5 project ideas derived
    strictly from the item's actual capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    All summaries are based solely on HuggingFace metadata &mdash; no hallucinated
    features or capabilities.
